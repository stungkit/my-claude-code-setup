## v1.41.9 — 2026-05-03

### Test-suite restructure — bundle the remaining 6 split slices

Six new sibling test files extracted from `tests/test_session_metrics.py` in one bundled commit (Tiers 4.2-4.10 of the post-audit improvement plan). The monolith drops from 10,647 → 1,149 lines (-9,498); the test surface area is now spread across 8 topic-focused modules.

**New files**:

- `tests/test_audit.py` (~1900 lines) — audit-extract.py helper-script tests + golden-file waste-analysis + `_classify_turn` waterfall + retry-chain detection.
- `tests/test_compare.py` (~4720 lines) — all compare-mode phases (1, 2, 3, 4-5, 6, 7, 10, prompt-steering, 8) — the LARGEST single topical block.
- `tests/test_report.py` (~1250 lines) — Phase A (cache_breaks / by_skill / by_subagent_type), Phase B (subagent attribution), Advisor feature.
- `tests/test_time.py` (~880 lines) — time-of-day, hour-of-day, weekday × hour matrix, 5-hour session blocks.
- `tests/test_render.py` (~610 lines) — chart-library dispatch + vendoring, uPlot / Chart.js renderers, Usage Insights section.
- `tests/test_instance.py` (~510 lines) — `--all-projects` discovery, `_build_instance_report` aggregation, `_run_all_projects` orchestration.

**What stays in `test_session_metrics.py`** (1,149 lines): cost-math, prompt-filter, dedup, fixture totals, cache-TTL drilldown (Proposal A), resume detection (Phase 3), content-block distribution (Proposal B), input validation, `_cwd_to_slug`, parse-jsonl perf-regression guard, T1.3-T1.5 advisory tests, v1.41.0 audit-driven fixes (parse_jsonl, dir overrides).

**Pattern**: each new file uses the cross-file module-aliasing dedup (`sys.modules.get(...) or _load_module(...)`) proven in v1.41.8. Two autouse fixtures (`isolate_projects_dir`, `_clear_pricing_cache`) duplicated into each split file because pytest autouse only fires for tests in the declaring module. `_build_fixture_report` (3-line helper) copied into the four slice files that need it.

**Tests**: 700 passed, 1 skipped — perfect parity with the pre-slice baseline. No behaviour change; pure refactor.

## v1.41.8 — 2026-05-03

### Test-suite restructure — pricing tests split into a sibling module

First slice of a multi-step split of the 10,942-line `tests/test_session_metrics.py` monolith. 21 pricing-domain tests move to a new sibling `tests/test_pricing.py` (~370 lines); the source file shrinks to 10,647 lines.

**Tests moved:**

- 13 `test_pricing_*` tests (Pricing block, lines 84–231 of the original)
- 3 `test_pricing_unknown_model_*` tests
- 1 parametrized `test_pricing_regex_boundaries_v1_41_0` (21 cases)
- 4 audit-extract pricing-table tests (`_input_rate_for_model_table`, `_pricing_parity_forward`, `_pricing_parity_reverse`, `_bare_prefix_needles_match_documented_set`)

**Module-aliasing fix.** Both files end with `_load_module("session_metrics", _SCRIPT)`, which re-execs unconditionally — whichever file pytest collects last wins the `sys.modules["session_metrics"]` slot, and leaf modules under `scripts/_*.py` use `_sm()` to fetch the canonical instance from `sys.modules` at call time. Without dedup, the loser file's `sm` reference points to a stale module and `monkeypatch.setattr(sm, "_UNKNOWN_MODELS_SEEN", set())` writes silently miss. Both files now check `sys.modules.get(...)` first; whichever file pytest loads first creates the canonical instance, the other reuses it.

**Cost / cache-write tests stayed put.** Per literal reading of the plan, only tests whose names contain `pricing` (plus the four audit-extract pricing-table tests) move in this slice; `test_cost_*`, `test_cache_write_split_*`, `test_no_cache_cost_*`, and the audit-extract `cache_break_*` tests stay in `test_session_metrics.py` for a future cost-domain slice.

**Tests:** 705 passed, 16 skipped (unchanged — pure file-split, no count delta). Patch bump because the skill payload's `tests/` directory bytes change and `_SKILL_VERSION` is embedded in every export.

## v1.41.7 — 2026-05-03

### Tier 3 from the Session 142 audit triage plan — `_no_cache_cost` symmetry

`_no_cache_cost` (`_turn_parser.py:535`) previously read the FLAT `cache_creation_input_tokens` field directly while `_cost` (line 467) routed the same data through `_cache_write_split` (which prefers nested `cache_creation.ephemeral_*` fields with a flat fallback). Empirically equal today — 55/55 turns per CLAUDE-activeContext.md:430-432 — but a silent future-drift risk: if Anthropic ever stops populating the flat field while keeping the nested ones, `_no_cache_cost` would silently undercount the cache-creation token portion, biasing the "savings from caching" delta downward on every turn. Routed `_no_cache_cost` through `_cache_write_split` and summed the buckets so both functions read the same source of truth.

Behaviour-preserving on real-world transcripts. The existing `test_no_cache_cost_includes_advisor_iterations` test (added in v1.41.4) and the broader cost suite stay green. Tier 2 (drift-guard test module) was added as part of the same audit triage but lives at the dev-repo top-level `tests/` directory and does not ship downstream — see the dev-repo CHANGELOG for those details.

**Tests**: 705 passed, 16 skipped (unchanged — Tier 3 is behaviour-preserving).

Patch bump for export traceability — `_SKILL_VERSION` is embedded in every export so byte-level changes bump the version even when behaviour is unchanged on real-world transcripts.

## v1.41.6 — 2026-05-03

### Tier 1 doc/lint sweep — README cache-format, active-context leaf count, audit-extract bare-prefix removal

Three small fixes from a triple-AI repo audit (Opus 4.7 + Codex GPT-5.5 + DeepSeek V4 Pro). All three correct stale or risky state without changing user-visible behaviour on real-world Anthropic models.

**README cache-format wording**: said "gzipped JSON dump" but the parse-cache format switched to pickle protocol 5 in `_SCRIPT_VERSION = "1.1.0"` (2026-04-30). Replaced with "pickle protocol 5 dump … keyed on file mtime and `_SCRIPT_VERSION`".

**CLAUDE-activeContext.md leaf count**: said "All 13 Graphify-derived sub-modules extracted" but the working tree now has 15 leaf modules (13 Graphify-derived + `_constants.py` + `_time_of_day.py`). Updated to current count without rewriting the historical Session 131 audit reference.

**`audit-extract.py:_INPUT_RATE_PER_M_BY_MODEL` bare-prefix entry**: removed `("claude-opus-4", 15.00)`. The bare prefix substring-matched any future Opus 4 minor (e.g. hypothetical `claude-opus-4-2`) at the OLD $15/M tier — a 3× over-charge on audit impact estimates if Anthropic ever ships such a model. Mirrors the same removal made in `session-metrics.py:_PRICING` in v1.41.2. Audit-extract's substring matcher now falls through to `claude-opus` at $5/M for any future Opus 4 minor — conservative under-charge rather than the prior 3× over-charge. Real Opus 4.0 IDs (`claude-opus-4`, `claude-opus-4-YYYYMMDD`) are an inherent main-vs-audit asymmetry: the main script's anchored regex prices them at $15; audit-extract now prices them at $5. Audit impact estimates are approximate by design and the under-direction is the safer drift mode.

**Tests**: 700 passed, 1 skipped (unchanged). Pricing parity tests stay green because the removed entry was never an exact key in `_PRICING` (the family-fallback regex covered it) and was never in the documented bare-prefix sentinel set `{"claude-sonnet", "claude-haiku", "claude-opus"}`.

Patch bump for export traceability — `_SKILL_VERSION` is embedded in every export so byte-level changes bump the version even when behaviour is unchanged on real-world transcripts.

## v1.41.5 — 2026-05-03

### P7 (partial) from Session 138 audit — `_detect_retry_chains` perf + audit-driven plan close-out

One perf micro-optimisation in `_data.py:_detect_retry_chains`. Existing 700/1 test suite covers the contract; behaviour-preserving change so no new tests added.

**`_detect_retry_chains` perf** — inner loop tokenized each `b_text` twice via `_tok` (once as the `SequenceMatcher` argument, once when reassigning `a_toks` after a match), so a session with `N` consecutive prompts walked `re.findall(r"\w+", text)` `2N(N-1)/2` times in the worst case. Pre-tokenize `prompted` once into a parallel `pre_toks: list[list[str]]` and read both `a_toks` and `b_toks` by index — collapses the repeat-tokenization to exactly `N` calls. Also hoisted `set(chain)` above the cost-summing generator so the inner `if t.get("index") in chain_set` lookup builds the set once per chain rather than once per turn iteration. Pure micro-opt, no behavioural change.

**P7 splits — deferred.** The remaining P7 items (split `render_html` 1310 lines, `_render_instance_html` 276 lines, `_build_report` 207 lines into smaller helpers) are pure cosmetic refactors with no behavioural change and high churn risk on ~1800 lines. Demoted to a separate future refactor release rather than bundled here.

**P8 — already shipped earlier.** The audit's "Sharing-time hygiene" recommendation (`--redact` flag + `chmod 0600`) was already implemented as `--redact-user-prompts` and the umbrella `--export-share-safe` flag (chmods every written export to `0600` and implies `--redact-user-prompts` + `--no-self-cost`). No code change. Documented gap (HTML/MD/CSV/text non-compare exports still embed verbatim prompt text even with `--redact-user-prompts`) is captured for any future expansion ask.

**Audit close-out.** This release closes the Session 138 `/audit-plugin` remediation plan — P1 → P6 shipped across v1.41.2 → v1.41.4, P7 perf shipped here, P7 splits deferred to a dedicated refactor release, P8 already shipped earlier.

**Tests**: 700 passed, 1 skipped (unchanged from v1.41.4 — perf change is behaviour-preserving).

## v1.41.4 — 2026-05-03

### P3 + P4 + P5 + P6 from Session 138 audit — advisor cost edge cases, atomic-replace cache invalidation, coverage gaps

Four audit items landed in one bump. P3 and P4 are dormant defensive fixes (no observable change on real-world transcripts). P5 closes coverage gaps that would have made any of the above silent. P6 is verified clean and closes without code change.

**P3 — advisor cost edge cases** (`_turn_parser.py:467-560`):

- **`_cost` line 488** — `it.get("model", model)` returns `""` when the iteration has the key but its value is empty (the default arg of `dict.get` only fires on missing keys, not empty values). Empty model string fell through `_pricing_for("")` → `_DEFAULT_PRICING` ($3/$15) instead of the parent turn's tier. Fixed with `it.get("model") or model` — collapses both missing-key and empty-string to the parent model. On Opus 4.7 parent the divergence was 60%+ on advisor cost.
- **`_advisor_info`** — same defect path. Function now takes the parent `model` parameter and uses `_pricing_for(adv_model or model)` instead of conditioning on emptiness and falling to `_DEFAULT_PRICING`. The displayed advisor model name (return tuple position 2) still goes `None` when the iteration carries no model — only the rate fallback changed.
- **`_no_cache_cost`** — previously charged the primary turn's tokens at non-cached rates but skipped the advisor iteration loop entirely. On advisor-using turns the "savings from caching" delta (`cost_usd - no_cache_cost`) was biased downward because the cached side included advisor cost while the no-cache side did not. Mirrored the iterations loop from `_cost` so the comparison is symmetric (advisor has no cache fields, so the cached and no-cache forms are identical for that portion).

**P4 — `_parse_cache_key` includes `st_size`** (`_data.py:113-148`):

The cache key was `path_hash + mtime_ns + _SCRIPT_VERSION`. Atomic-replace tools (`cp -p`, `rsync --inplace`, restore-from-backup) preserve `mtime_ns` while changing content — the cache would silently serve the stale pickled blob. Added `st_size` to the key (already in scope at the `path.stat()` call site, threaded through). All existing on-disk blobs are invalidated by the format change; cold rebuild is automatic on first invocation after upgrade. The prune-on-write logic is unaffected — its prefix glob still catches stranded blobs for the same source path.

**P5 — five new tests** (`tests/test_session_metrics.py`):

1. `test_cached_parse_invalidates_on_size` — same `mtime_ns`, different content size → fresh blob (the P4 invariant).
2. `test_cached_parse_invalidates_on_script_version` — bumping `_SCRIPT_VERSION` mints a new key; old blob pruned.
3. `test_weekly_rollup_boundary_inclusivity` — half-open `[start, end)` math at the `now-7d` and `now-14d` cutoffs; an off-by-one swap on either edge would silently double-count or drop a turn at the seam.
4. `test_advisor_empty_model_falls_back_to_parent_rate` — the P3 invariant: empty `iterations[i].model` charges at the parent turn's rate, not `_DEFAULT_PRICING`.
5. `test_no_cache_cost_includes_advisor_iterations` — the P3 symmetry invariant: `_no_cache_cost` mirrors the advisor loop in `_cost`.

`test_parse_cache_key_includes_path_hash` was updated to pass the new `size` argument.

**P6 — verified clean, no code change.** The audit's NOVEL-2 claim (`compute_instance_baseline` reads a wrong field name at `audit-extract.py:998`) was refuted against a live instance-mode export: the export emits both `project_count` (scalar, primary read) and `projects` (list, fallback), so the existing `data.get("project_count", len(data.get("projects", [])))` is correct.

**Tests**: 5 added, 1 updated for new signature. **700 passed, 1 skipped** (was 695 in v1.41.3).

Patch bump per repo policy: any skill-payload byte change bumps `_SKILL_VERSION` for export traceability. The advisor and cache-key fixes are dormant under normal transcripts (real `iterations[i].model` is always populated, real upgrade paths bump mtime), so users see no observable behaviour change — only the defensive fallback shifted to the more accurate path.

## v1.41.3 — 2026-05-03

### P2 from Session 138 audit — pricing-table parity guard between session-metrics and audit-extract

Test-only patch. `audit-session-metrics/scripts/audit-extract.py` carries a hand-maintained `_INPUT_RATE_PER_M_BY_MODEL` table used to estimate cache_break and idle_gap_cache_decay impact. With no automated check, a future Anthropic price change could land in `session-metrics.py:_PRICING` while the audit-extract table silently keeps the stale rate — silently mis-estimating impact on every audit until someone notices.

**Fix**: three new tests in `tests/test_session_metrics.py`:

1. **Forward parity** (`test_audit_extract_pricing_parity_forward`) — every Anthropic-prefixed key in `_PRICING` must resolve to the same input rate via `audit_extract._input_rate_for_model`.
2. **Reverse parity** (`test_audit_extract_pricing_parity_reverse`) — every entry in `_INPUT_RATE_PER_M_BY_MODEL` (excluding three documented bare-prefix catchalls) must resolve to the same input rate via `session_metrics._pricing_for`.
3. **Bare-prefix sentinel** (`test_audit_extract_bare_prefix_needles_match_documented_set`) — keeps the documented exemption set in sync with the table; adding or removing a bare prefix without updating the exemption would silently weaken the parity guard.

The bare-prefix entries (`claude-sonnet`, `claude-haiku`, `claude-opus`) are family-tier substring fallbacks for hypothetical un-versioned Anthropic IDs. Real transcripts always carry a version, so the divergence from `_DEFAULT_PRICING` is dormant; the sentinel test pins the exemption so future changes get reviewed. Non-Anthropic models (glm-*, openai/*, deepseek/*) are intentionally out of scope: cache_break / idle_gap_cache_decay never fire on them because those models lack prompt caching.

**Tests**: 3 added. **695 passed, 1 skipped** (was 692 in v1.41.2).

No production code changed. No behaviour, interface, or export-format change. Patch bump for export traceability.

## v1.41.2 — 2026-05-03

### P1 from Session 138 audit — wrong-model rate fallback for unknown sub-variants

Latent silent-overcharge bugs in `_pricing_for` for hypothetical future Anthropic releases. Surfaced by all four passes of the Session 138 audit (own + perf-fork + Codex + DeepSeek). Two cases collapsed into one fix:

- **`claude-opus-4-N` for N ≥ 8** prefix-matched the bare `claude-opus-4` entry in `_PRICING` and silently 3×-overcharged at OLD-tier $15/$75 instead of NEW-tier $5/$25 (the rate that has held across 4-5/4-6/4-7).
- **`claude-haiku-4-6` / `claude-haiku-5+`** had no Haiku prefix entry at all and fell through to `_DEFAULT_PRICING` (Sonnet $3/$15) — also a 3× overcharge over the correct Haiku $1/$5.

**The fix** has three parts:

1. **Anchored regex for Opus 4.0** in `_PRICING_PATTERNS`: `^claude-opus-4(?:-\d{8})?$` matches the bare ID and an 8-digit-date-suffixed form. The bare `claude-opus-4` key was removed from `_PRICING` so the prefix sweep no longer silently catches future minors.
2. **New `_PRICING_FAMILY_FALLBACKS` list** in `session-metrics.py`, consulted by `_pricing_for` AFTER the prefix sweep miss but BEFORE the `_DEFAULT_PRICING` fallback. Patterns: future Opus 4 minors → NEW tier; future Opus 5+ → NEW tier; future Haiku 4 minors → Haiku tier; future Haiku 5+ → Haiku tier. Each match adds the model to `_UNKNOWN_MODELS_SEEN` so the at-exit advisory tells the user to refresh `references/pricing.md`.
3. **Advisory wording** updated from "priced at Sonnet rates ($3/$15 per 1M tokens)" to "priced at fallback rates (verify in references/pricing.md)" — the family-fallback path lands on the family's tier, not always Sonnet.

**Sonnet intentionally NOT given a family fallback.** `claude-sonnet-4` is a bare prefix entry and Sonnet 4.x has held one rate tier across all minors, so the silent prefix-sweep behavior is correct for Sonnet. A future `claude-sonnet-5` would need an explicit `_PRICING` row regardless.

**Tests**: `test_pricing_prefix_fallback` deleted (asserted the buggy behaviour). Eight new tests cover the bare ID, date-suffixed Opus 4.0, opus-4-8, opus-4-8 with date, opus-5, haiku-4-6, haiku-9, the silent date-suffixed known model path, and opus-4-1-with-date silent path. **692 passed, 1 skipped.**

## v1.41.1 — 2026-05-02

### Internal: ruff hygiene cleanup (no behaviour change)

Silenced the 22 pre-existing ruff errors across the four v1.41.0-modified files. No behaviour change, no interface change, no export-format change. Patch bump is for **export traceability** — `_SKILL_VERSION` is embedded in every export, so leaving the version unchanged after byte-level skill changes would make exports indistinguishable from the prior set.

**4 documented re-imports pinned with `# noqa: F401` + `# noqa: I001`** at `session-metrics.py:30,33,36`. Tests patch them via `sm.secrets`, `sm.ZoneInfo`, `sm.ZoneInfoNotFoundError`; `ruff check --fix` would delete them and break 7+ tests.

**15 cosmetic auto-fixes**: 8 × `timezone.utc` → `datetime.UTC` (UP017) and 7 × redundant `f` prefix removal (F541).

**3 SIM105 — split treatment**: 2 × `try/except: pass` → `with contextlib.suppress(...)` in `_cli.py` (where comments live above the try); 1 × `# noqa: SIM105` in `_data.py:192` where the on-`pass` comment is locality-dependent.

**Tests**: 684 passed, 1 skipped (unchanged from v1.41.0 baseline).

## v1.41.0 — 2026-05-02

### Audit-driven correctness + ergonomic batch

DeepSeek V4 Pro audit (re-validated by Codex GPT-5.5 + code-searcher) surfaced six actionable findings; six rejections were already correct.

**P0-A — `assert` → explicit error/exit at `session-metrics.py:_load_leaf`.** Under `python -O` the assert was stripped and a missing leaf module crashed cryptically. Now mirrors `_cli.py:_load_compare_module`'s explicit `if/print/sys.exit(1)` pattern.

**P0-B — `_PRICING_PATTERNS` regex hardening (behaviour change).** Three fixes:
- Numeric-suffix families (`gpt-5.5`, `qwen3.6`, `mimo-v2.5`, `kimi-k2.6`, `minimax-m2.7`) carry `(?!\d)` — extra-digit IDs (`gpt-5.55`) fall through to default rates.
- Provider/model separators switched from bare `.` to `[-_/.]` — `deepseekXv4Yflash` no longer satisfies `deepseek.v4.*flash`.
- Suffix tokens (`pro`, `flash`, `plus`) anchored with `\b`.

**Behaviour-impact note**: model names that previously over-matched the looser regex now route to default Sonnet rates. Re-run historical reports for accurate before/after.

**P1-A — `_parse_jsonl` defensive `isinstance(dict)` filter.** A stray non-dict line that parsed as valid JSON would `AttributeError` at `_extract_turns`. Now skipped via the same warn path as malformed JSON.

**P1-B — `--cache-dir` flag + `CLAUDE_SESSION_METRICS_CACHE_DIR` env var.** Parse-cache directory gains operator override; same precedence shape as `--projects-dir` (flag > env > default).

**P1-C — `--export-dir` flag + `CLAUDE_SESSION_METRICS_EXPORT_DIR` env var.** Export directory gains the same override shape; `_instance_export_root` flows through automatically.

**P2-A — `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=128)` on `_pricing_for`.** Removes the redundant three-tier resolution `_cost`/`_no_cache_cost`/`_advisor_info` each performed per turn. Idempotent set side-effect preserved; tests gain an autouse `_clear_pricing_cache` fixture.

`SKILL.md` and `references/pricing.md` updated for parity with the new regex + flags. **684 passed, 1 skipped.**

---

## v1.40.2 — 2026-05-01

### Post-split audit-2 cleanup (P1 + P1b + P2)

Second-pass audit of the 13-module split caught three follow-ups the first audit missed. LSP `findReferences` + Pyright diagnostics surfaced two; the third was already flagged as a latent maintenance trap.

**P1 — `_PROJECTS_DIR_OVERRIDE` dead-seed elimination.** `_cli.py:49` had a leaf-level seed even though every read/write already routed through `_sm()._PROJECTS_DIR_OVERRIDE`. Same shape as the v1.40.1 Bug 2/3 fix for `_VENDOR_CHARTS_DIR` / `_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_CHARTS`. Leaf seed deleted; canonical attr now defined directly on the orchestrator beside the other two.

**P1b — drop two unused imports.** `_data.py` collapsed `from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone` (timedelta unused). `_cli.py` dropped a redundant function-local `import importlib.util` shadowing the top-level import.

**P2 — collapse the `_CACHE_BREAK_DEFAULT_THRESHOLD = 100_000` triplicate.** Three identical literals in `_data.py`, `_dispatch.py`, `_report.py` (default-arg seeds, intentionally retained in v1.40.0 because Python evaluates `def fn(x=_NAME)` at def-time). New `_constants.py` zero-dep sibling leaf holds the single canonical literal. Orchestrator loads it first via `_load_leaf("_constants")` and keeps the module-level alias for runtime reads + tests.

No behaviour change. 653 tests pass, 1 skipped.

---

## v1.40.1 — 2026-05-01

### Post-split bug fixes and import cleanup

Three bugs found by systematic audit of the 13-module monolith split (Sessions 129–132) and corrected in Session 133.

**Bug 1 — `_dispatch.py` cache-break threshold fallback.** `_CACHE_BREAK_DEFAULT_THRESHOLD` in the HTML-render path was a locally-defined constant that ceased to exist in `_dispatch.py` after the split; the value was the same as `_sm()._CACHE_BREAK_DEFAULT_THRESHOLD` so it silently read the right number, but would have drifted if the default ever changed. Fixed to route through `_sm()`.

**Bug 2/3 — `_charts.py` vendor-dir and allow-unverified constants.** `_VENDOR_CHARTS_DIR` and `_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_CHARTS` were copied into `_charts.py` as seed variables (unnecessary duplicates of the bindings already owned by `session-metrics.py`). All reads inside `_charts.py` now route through `_sm()`. The four tests that patched the now-removed module-local attributes were updated to patch only `sm.*` (sufficient since all paths go through `_sm()`).

**Import cleanup.** Nine imports moved entirely into leaf modules during the split (`io`, `json`, `os`, `pickle`, `time`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `timezone`) removed from `session-metrics.py`. Three imports retained as module-level attributes for test monkeypatching via `sm.*`: `secrets`, `ZoneInfo`, `ZoneInfoNotFoundError`.

**Audit-skill playbook reinforcement.** `SKILL.md` and all five playbook references in `audit-session-metrics` now carry an explicit guard prohibiting intermediate Python synthesis scripts; the Write tool must be used directly to produce JSON/markdown artefacts.

653 tests pass, 1 skipped.

---

## v1.40.0 — 2026-04-30

### Skill version embedded in all exports

`_SKILL_VERSION = "1.40.0"` added to `session-metrics.py`. Every export now surfaces the skill version that generated it: HTML meta line appends `· skill v1.40.0`; Markdown `Generated:` line appends `|  Skill: v1.40.0`; JSON export gains a top-level `"skill_version"` field; CSV exports prepend a comment row `# Session Metrics skill v1.40.0, <generated_at>, <mode>`. `_SKILL_VERSION` must match `plugin.json` / `marketplace.json` and is bumped whenever those bump. CLAUDE.md sync-procedure updated with the instruction.

---

## v1.39.0 — 2026-04-30

### Cache hygiene — daily lazy global prune

`_prune_cache_global` runs at most once per 24 hours (sentinel file in cache dir) on every normal invocation. It deletes three categories of blobs: (1) **orphaned** — the UUID stem matches no JSONL under `_projects_dir()` (deleted project, renamed slug); (2) **inactive session** — source JSONL mtime > 60 days AND blob mtime > 30 days (session long closed); (3) **stale blob** — blob mtime > 30 days even for a semi-active session. The 30 d / 60 d split protects blobs that are being served on warm hits for an ongoing project. Subagent JSONLs (`*/subagents/*.jsonl`) are included in the live-session index so their blobs are not incorrectly treated as orphaned. No new CLI flags; honours `--no-cache`. 647 → 653 passed, 1 skipped.

---

## v1.38.0 — 2026-04-30

### Cache hygiene — self-pruning parse cache (option a)

`_cached_parse_jsonl` now deletes stranded blobs for the same source file on every cache write. Each JSONL has a unique `{stem}__{path_hash}__` prefix in the cache filename; any blob sharing that prefix but not matching the just-written filename was stranded by a previous `mtime_ns` bump or `_SCRIPT_VERSION` change. The prune glob runs only on cache miss (post-successful write) — zero latency on warm hits. Failures are non-fatal; the parse result is always returned. No `_SCRIPT_VERSION` bump (cache schema unchanged), no new CLI flags.

**Motivation.** v1.37.0 switched to pickle (no compression), which is ~2× larger per blob (~9 MB → ~19 MB per typical session). Live sessions receive a new `mtime_ns` on every appended turn, stranding the prior blob each time. At project scale the orphaned files accumulate silently — 768 MB / 1 584 files measured on the dev machine before this was noticed. The per-file prune targets the structural cause (same-source stranding) without a whole-cache scan.

**Stdlib-only, cross-platform, single-user-local trust model.** No new dependencies or CLI surface.

### Tests

Four new tests; one existing test updated to match the new prune behaviour. 643 → 647 passed, 1 skipped.

- `test_cached_parse_prunes_stale_mtime` — mtime bump leaves exactly 1 blob.
- `test_cached_parse_prunes_stale_version` — version bump leaves exactly 1 (new-version) blob.
- `test_cached_parse_prune_does_not_touch_other_jsonls` — prune for source A leaves source B's blob intact.
- `test_cached_parse_prune_failure_is_non_fatal` — read-only cache dir does not propagate OSError; entries are still returned.
- `test_cached_parse_invalidates_on_mtime` updated: now asserts 1 blob post-bump (was 2 pre-prune).

## v1.37.0 — 2026-04-30

### Performance — pickle parse cache (-67% cold / -18% warm / -17% project)

Switched the parse cache at `~/.cache/session-metrics/parse/` from gzip+JSON to `pickle` protocol 5 (stdlib, no compression). Single-file change with broad wins across cold parse, warm cache hits, and `--project-cost` fanout on a 158-session corpus.

**Implementation.** `_cached_parse_jsonl` swaps `gzip.open` + `json.load`/`json.dump` for `open` + `pickle.load`/`pickle.dump(protocol=5)`. Filename suffix `.json.gz` → `.pkl`. Read-side exception catch updated from `(OSError, json.JSONDecodeError)` → `(OSError, pickle.UnpicklingError, EOFError)`. Atomic write via random-suffix tmp + `os.replace` is unchanged (POSIX + Windows safe since Py 3.3). `import gzip` removed (no longer used anywhere); `import pickle` added.

**Cache schema bump.** `_SCRIPT_VERSION` 1.0-rc.5 → 1.1.0 invalidates every existing cache blob exactly once. First run after upgrade rebuilds the cache transparently — slower than a warm hit but identical cold-path cost. No data loss; the JSONL transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/` are the source of truth.

**Disk trade-off.** Pickle (no compression) is ~2× larger on disk than the prior gzip+JSON: ~9 MB → ~19 MB for a typical 28 MB JSONL session. At project scale (158 sessions): ~1.4 GB → ~3 GB cache footprint. Acceptable for a developer-tool cache living in `~/.cache/`. Stale cache management (no GC today; mtime_ns and version bumps strand prior blobs) is a known follow-up.

**Stdlib-only invariant preserved.** No new dependencies; the shipped skill remains stdlib-only per `plugin.json` `strict: true`. Cross-platform: identical behaviour on macOS, Linux, Windows. Trust model is single-user-local; pickle of the script's own writes is safe.

### Tests

Four test sites updated to match the new cache extension (`*.json.gz` → `*.pkl`) and docstring ("gzip+JSON" → "pickle"). 643 passed, 1 skipped — same count as v1.36.0.

## v1.36.0 — 2026-04-30

### Sharing-time hygiene — `--export-share-safe` one-flag pre-share gesture (P5)

Closes the audit-driven plan's Priority 5 block. Adds a single CLI flag for the common "I'm about to publish or paste this somewhere" workflow, plus README / SKILL.md guidance documenting the redact + share-safe surfaces.

**P5.1 — Documentation for `--redact-user-prompts` + `--export-share-safe`.**
The README gains a new *Sharing exports safely* subsection under *Privacy* with an at-a-glance table of which surfaces are redacted (JSON + compare HTML) versus chmod-only (HTML / MD / CSV / text). The most-used-commands block gains an `--export-share-safe` example. SKILL.md documents both flags in the *Other useful flags* table.

**P5.2 — `--export-share-safe` flag.**
One-flag bundle that implies `--redact-user-prompts` and `--no-self-cost`, and chmods every written export file to `0o600` (`rw-------`) immediately after the write. Wired through `_write_output`, `_dispatch`, `_dispatch_instance`, plus the compare-mode write sites (`_run_compare`, `_run_compare_run`, `_emit_compare_run_extras`) and the split-HTML / per-project drilldown writers — every export-file write site is covered. Implication is applied in `main()` after `parse_args` so all downstream code paths read a consistent argparse namespace regardless of which combination the user typed. Verified end-to-end against a real 361-turn session: 198 turns redacted, 0 with verbatim prompt text, `self_cost` absent from JSON, both files chmod'd to `-rw-------`. Help text explicitly documents the JSON-only redaction caveat (HTML / MD / CSV / text are chmod'd but contain verbatim prompts) so users pair `--export-share-safe` with `--output json` for full redaction.

### Tests

3 new regression tests (argparse implication: `--export-share-safe → redact + no_self_cost`; chmod 0o600 on a written file with `share_safe=True`; default `share_safe=False` does NOT chmod). 643 total tests pass (1 skipped).

## v1.35.0 — 2026-04-29

### Insight + sharing — P2 batch (warmup-trigger length cap + JSON redaction)

Two follow-up fixes from the Session 112 audit (P2.3, P2.4). Schema-additive: existing tooling keeps working; new behaviour is opt-in.

**P2.3 — `session_warmup_overhead` now length-agnostic.**
The trigger was previously gated on `len(turns) <= 15`, which silently silenced mid-length sessions where the first turn still dominated cost. A 17-turn session with 30% first-turn cost never fired. The cap is dropped: any session with `first_turn_cost / total_cost > 20%` now surfaces. To keep the signal honest on long sessions, the suggested severity downgrades to `low` (with a `downgrade_reason`) when `total_turns > 30 AND first_pct < 30` — the warmup cost amortises across many turns. Default severity is unchanged (`medium`); the playbook row in `quick-audit.md` was rewritten to match.

**P2.4 — `--redact-user-prompts` wired through `render_json`.**
The `--redact-user-prompts` flag at `session-metrics.py:10719` was silently ineffective on JSON exports — the redact path only ran in compare HTML, while `render_json` wrote full `prompt_text` and `assistant_text` verbatim. The flag now also masks `prompt_text` / `prompt_snippet` and `assistant_text` / `assistant_snippet` on every turn of single-session and project JSON exports with `[redacted]`. Tool inputs, slash-command names, and structured cost / token fields stay visible so the redacted JSON is still useful for cost analysis. Empty fields stay empty (truthiness preserved). No-op for instance-scope JSON, which carries no per-turn records. Help text updated to document JSON coverage explicitly.

### Tests

8 new regression tests (4 for P2.3 length cap + downgrade matrix, 4 for P2.4 redaction including default-off, structured-field visibility, and empty-field preservation). 624 total tests pass (1 skipped).

---

## v1.34.0 — 2026-04-29

### Insight — P2 batch (cost-share + paste-bomb classification)

Two user-visible insight gaps from the Session 112 audit (P2.1, P2.2). Schema-additive: existing tooling that only reads turn counts keeps working; new fields are extra.

**P2.1 — Cost share alongside turn share in Models table + audit playbook.**
`_model_counts(turns)` (returning `{name: int}`) was renamed to `_model_breakdown(turns)` returning `{name: {turns, cost_usd}}` — same shape that `_aggregate_models` already produced at instance scope, eliminating the cross-scope divergence. Markdown / HTML / text Models tables gain `Turn %` and `Cost %` columns. `audit-extract.compute_baseline` (and project / instance variants) emits `baseline.models` as `{name: {turns, turns_pct, cost_usd, cost_pct}}` so the audit playbook's `model_split_clause` renders by-cost without LLM arithmetic. Pre-v1.34 exports (where `models` was `{name: int}`) still parse — `cost_pct` is `null` so the playbook falls back to turn share. The audit playbook rule was rewritten to lead with cost share and add a turn-share aside when the gap is ≥10pp. Verified on a real session: Opus 78% turns / 96% cost — turn share alone massively understates the dominant model.

**P2.2 — `paste_bomb` waste category.**
`_classify_turn` now has a `paste_bomb` arm: prompts >5 000 chars classify as `paste_bomb`, matching the threshold `audit-extract.py`'s detailed scan already used for its `paste_bombs` finding. Fires above `reasoning` in the priority waterfall (paste behaviour is the actionable user signal, thinking is a downstream effect); subagent dispatch still wins. Added to `_RISK_CATEGORIES` and the waste-distribution bar (bright red, between `oververbose_edit` and `dead_end`). Session 112 turns 15/23 (27 KB skill-injected slash-command bodies) — previously classified as `productive` — now surface in the waste bar and per-turn drawer.

### Tests

8 new regression tests (3 for P2.1, 5 for P2.2). 616 total tests pass (1 skipped).

---

## v1.33.0 — 2026-04-29

### Correctness — P1 audit-pipeline fixes (Sessions 113–116)

Four correctness fixes in the `audit-session-metrics` and `session-metrics` audit pipelines, batched together so users get a single coherent release rather than four point-bumps. No schema change. No flag change. The HTML/JSON exports look the same; the underlying numbers are now right.

**P1.1 — `file_re_reads` detector reads `input_preview`** (Session 113).
`audit-extract.py:710-715` previously looked up `tool_use_detail` entries via `d["input"]["file_path"]`, but the export schema only carries `input_preview` (a string from `_summarise_tool_input`). The dict access silently returned `None` on every `Read`, so `detailed_candidates.file_re_reads` was always `[]` regardless of how many times the same path was re-read. Detector now reads `input_preview` directly. Verified end-to-end against a 328-turn export — surfaced 9 real re-read paths where the old detector returned `[]`. (Codex novel finding from Session 112.)

**P1.2 — Per-model input rate for `cache_break` and `idle_gap_cache_decay` impact** (Session 114).
The audit pipeline used a hardcoded `OPUS_INPUT_RATE_PER_M = 5.00` to convert uncached / cache-write tokens into dollars regardless of which model the turn actually ran on, overstating Sonnet by 67% and Haiku by 400%. Replaced with `_INPUT_RATE_PER_M_BY_MODEL` (substring-priority table covering Opus 4.5/4.6/4.7 / Opus 4.0/4.1 / Sonnet 3.x/4.x / Haiku 4.5 / Haiku 3.5) plus an `_input_rate_for_model` helper. `_detect_idle_gap_cache_decay` now reads the turn's `model`; the cache_break trigger sums per-break impact at each break's own model rate and emits a model-aware `impact_basis` (mixed-model variant when breaks span models). Verified end-to-end on a mixed Opus + Haiku export: cache_break impact $1.28 → $0.86 (33% overstatement removed).

**P1.3 — `_BASH_PATH_RE` requires leading-dot or start-of-arg boundary** (Session 115).
The bash-branch path regex previously allowed *zero* leading dots (`\.{0,2}/`), so a longer string like `cat .claude/skills/foo.py` would yield the substring `/skills/foo.py`. In the re-read detector, that fragment formed its own bucket separate from the legitimate full-path access, silently merging same-suffix files across different project subtrees. Anchored the regex to a start-of-arg boundary via leading `(?<![\w.])` and split the previously combined `\.{0,2}/` alternative into two explicit branches: `\.{1,2}/...` (dot-relative) and `/...` (absolute). Trade-off: `.name/...` style hidden-dir paths in Bash commands no longer contribute to the bash-branch detector at all; net coverage preserved on realistic workloads because the same files are also accessed through Read/Edit/Write (absolute paths, separate detector branch). Verified end-to-end: reaccessed-path count dropped 29 (polluted) → 23 (clean), top-10 free of phantom fragments.

**P1.4 — Marginal-cost attribution in `_detect_file_reaccesses`** (Session 116).
The detector previously summed each path's `cost_usd` as the entire turn cost for every turn that touched the path — a single Bash arg in a 10-tool turn would charge that path 100% of the turn cost, and two re-read paths sharing one turn would each be charged 100%, so `total_reaccess_cost` could exceed the underlying session cost. Session 112's audit attributed $1.11 (54% of session cost) to file_reaccesses on a single Bash arg. Fix: weight each turn's contribution by `path_reads_in_turn / total_tool_calls_in_turn`. Total contribution per turn is now bounded by the turn cost. Verified end-to-end on a 328-turn export: `total_reaccess_cost` $24.70 → $22.80 (46.3% → 42.7%), largest per-path drop $4.81 → $3.51.

### Tests

12 new regression tests covering the four P1 fixes (4 for P1.1+P1.2 in `audit_extract`, 8 for P1.3+P1.4 in `_detect_file_reaccesses`). 612 total tests pass (1 skipped, pre-existing).

---

## v1.32.0 — 2026-04-29

### Feature — project-scope and instance-scope audit support in `audit-session-metrics`

`audit-extract.py` now auto-detects the JSON scope from `data["mode"]` and branches into three code paths:

**Project scope** (`project_*.json`):
- Computes per-session cost ranking (`top_expensive_sessions`, top 5), poor-cache-health sessions (avg cache-hit < 80%, cost > $0.10), sessions with cache breaks, weekly cost and cache delta.
- Suppresses intra-session-only triggers (`idle_gap_cache_decay`, `session_warmup_overhead`) via a `SESSION_ONLY_METRICS` frozenset — these are not meaningful across a multi-session aggregate.
- Baseline gains `sessions_count` and `cost_per_session_avg_usd` in addition to session fields.

**Instance scope** (`instance/*/index.json`):
- Cross-project cost ranking (`top_expensive_projects`, top 5 with cost-share %), poor-cache projects, instance-wide cache-hit average.
- `fired_triggers` and `top_expensive_turns` are always `[]` — no per-turn data exists at instance scope.
- `None`-safe evaluation for `cache_hit_pct` and `cache_savings` (present-but-`null` in instance JSON); fixed by using `or 0` instead of `.get(k, 0)`.

**Schema**: `DIGEST_SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped `1.2 → 1.3` (additive — adds `scope`, `project_analysis`, `instance_analysis` fields).

**New reference playbooks** (three files under `audit-session-metrics/references/`):
- `project-quick-audit.md` — session breakdown table, poor-cache list, cache-break list, weekly trend, fix-first bullets.
- `project-detailed-audit.md` — extends quick with per-session turn drilldown, model distribution, cache-outlier hypothesis.
- `instance-quick-audit.md` — covers both quick and detailed at instance scope (same playbook, no per-turn drilldown available).

**SKILL.md routing**: `audit-session-metrics/SKILL.md` gains a scope routing dispatch matrix replacing the single-row session-only table; `session-metrics/SKILL.md` removes the scope guard that suppressed the post-export audit suggestion for project/instance exports and replaces it with scope-aware suggestions (project → per-session audit, instance → cross-project audit).

### Tests

20 new unit tests in `tests/test_session_metrics.py` (596 total, +20 since v1.31.0):
- `project_filename_parts` / `instance_filename_parts` parser variants.
- `detect_scope` from `data["mode"]` and from filename fallback.
- `compute_project_baseline` and `compute_instance_baseline` (including `None`-safe fields).
- `compute_project_session_analysis` and `compute_instance_project_analysis`.
- `build_digest` for all three scopes — schema version, `scope` field, suppressed triggers, empty instance fired/turns.
- Reference file existence and `v1.3` schema header anchors.

---

## v1.31.0 — 2026-04-29

### Feature — natural-language export dispatch keywords

`SKILL.md` gains an `export` dispatch keyword and a new `## Export shortcuts` section so users can invoke the skill with natural-language phrases documented in the plugin marketplace article.

**New dispatch keywords** (matched on `$ARGUMENTS[0]`):

- `export` — routes to `## Export shortcuts`; scans the full argument string to determine scope and output formats
- `project` — runs `--project-cost`, also picking up `--output` format flags from remaining args
- `project-cost` — alias for `project`

**Export shortcuts routing** (priority-ordered, first match wins):

1. Arg string contains `all-projects` → `--all-projects --output <formats>`
2. Arg string contains `project` → `--project-cost --output <formats>`
3. Otherwise → single session `--session <id> --output <formats>`

Format flags (`html`, `csv`, `md`/`markdown`) are inferred from the argument text; `json` is always appended per the post-export audit convention. Bare invocations without a format word default to `--output json`.

**Example mappings now explicitly documented:**

| Invocation | Command |
|---|---|
| `export session` | `--session … --output json` |
| `export session to html` | `--session … --output html json` |
| `export project` | `--project-cost --output json` |
| `export project to html` | `--project-cost --output html json` |
| `export project sessions to html` | `--project-cost --output html json` |
| `export all-projects` | `--all-projects --output json` |
| `export all-projects to html` | `--all-projects --output html json` |

**Bug fixed:** the prior `export all-projects` path would have matched the `project` substring check and silently routed to `--project-cost`; priority ordering now prevents this.

---

## v1.30.1 — 2026-04-29

### Fix — audit suggestion shown after every export

When the session-metrics skill is invoked with `--output html` (or `csv` or `md`), it now automatically appends `json` to the format list if absent. This ensures the JSON sidecar is always written and the `/audit-session-metrics quick <path>` suggestion is always shown — previously the hint was suppressed on html-only exports, requiring a redundant second `/session-metrics --output json` invocation before the audit could be run.

The Haiku model-pinning on the audit skill is unaffected — the skill still prints the slash-command suggestion rather than invoking the audit programmatically.

---

## v1.30.0 — 2026-04-29

### Feature — session archetype classifier (Tier-2 batch 2: detect-only) + first-turn cost share

The audit-session-metrics skill gains a top-level `session_archetype` classifier and adds `first_turn_cost_usd` / `first_turn_cost_share_pct` to the baseline. Both are forward-looking digest fields that v1.31.0's archetype-conditional severity overrides will consume; v1.30.0 ships the classifier as **detect-only** so it can be calibrated against real audit sidecars before the override matrix lands.

### Schema

`digest_schema_version` and `audit_schema_version` bump to **1.2** (additive — no breaking changes; v1.1 readers continue to work):

- New top-level field `session_archetype` (string enum): `agent_workflow` | `short_test` | `long_debug` | `code_writing` | `exploratory_chat` | `unknown`. The default `unknown` is intentional — biased toward not labelling at low confidence (same lesson as v1.29.0's forbidden `"other"` enum).
- New top-level field `archetype_signals` (debugging dict): `turns`, `subagent_share_pct`, `cache_hit_pct`, `cache_break_count`, `cache_break_pct`, `thinking_turn_pct`, `tool_call_total`, `edit_write_pct_of_tools`, `read_pct_of_tools`, `bash_pct_of_tools`, `tools_per_turn`. Non-negotiable for the v1.31.0 override matrix to read; also a debugging surface when archetype labels feel wrong.
- New baseline fields `first_turn_cost_usd` and `first_turn_cost_share_pct`. The "first turn" skips `<synthetic>` and `is_resume_marker` turns so resumed sessions don't mis-attribute warmup cost to a placeholder.

### Classifier priority chain (first match wins)

1. `agent_workflow` — `subagent_share_pct >= 30`
2. `short_test` — `0 < turns <= 5`
3. `long_debug` — `turns > 30` AND (`cache_break_pct > 2%` OR `cache_hit_pct < 70`)
4. `code_writing` — `turns > 5` AND `Edit + Write >= 25%` of tool calls
5. `exploratory_chat` — `turns > 5` AND `tool_call_total / turns < 1.0`
6. `unknown` — default

The 2% cache-break threshold mirrors the existing `cache_break` trigger's downgrade rule: a single break in 200 turns is below typical concern, so the existing trigger downgrades to low — and the archetype must not pin the same session as `long_debug` while the trigger is calling it routine.

### Calibration corpus (N=2)

The classifier was calibrated against the two unique session JSON exports in `exports/session-metrics/`:

- **session 1bf0a383** (168 turns, $8.44, 75% thinking, Edit/Write 15%, tools/turn 1.18) → `unknown` (no rule fires; honest fallback).
- **session 8461c187** (173 turns, $41.49, 32% thinking, Edit/Write 36%, cache_break_pct 0.58%) → `code_writing` (Edit/Write ≥ 25%; cache_break_pct below 2% so long_debug correctly skipped).

With N=2 the thresholds are working hypotheses, not measured baselines. Treat the override matrix slated for v1.31.0 as gated on at least ~10 audit sidecars existing across multiple session archetypes.

### Why detect-only first

The original Tier-2 plan bundled the archetype classifier and severity-override matrix into one ship. Splitting them means v1.30.0's archetype labels can be observed against real audit runs before the matrix locks in any decisions on guessed thresholds. If a label feels wrong on a real session, fix the threshold; only then ship the override matrix.

### Playbook contract

Both quick-audit.md and detailed-audit.md updated:

- Schema reference bumped to v1.2 with a v1.1 → v1.2 additive migration note.
- New "Session archetype" subsection in quick-audit.md (priority order + thresholds, no narrative in render).
- New "Session archetype + first-turn warmup" subsection in detailed-audit.md (one-sentence narrative in Baseline section when archetype != unknown; first_turn_cost_share narrative gated on `turns > 30 AND share > 5%`).
- Detailed-audit.md explicitly states first_turn_cost_share is **not** a `finding` and never enters `quick_wins` or `structural_fixes` — first-turn setup is unavoidable, so it's framing context, not actionable advice.

### Tests

15 new unit tests in `tests/test_session_metrics.py` (576 total, +15 since v1.29.0):

- `test_audit_extract_digest_schema_version_is_1_2` — schema bump + presence of new fields.
- 6 archetype trigger tests (one per enum value plus `unknown`).
- `test_audit_extract_archetype_long_debug_skips_low_density_breaks` — guards the 0.5% case from v1.29.0's calibration session.
- `test_audit_extract_archetype_priority_subagent_wins_over_short_test` — confirms the priority chain.
- `test_audit_extract_archetype_unknown_on_zero_turns` — short_test must require `turns > 0`.
- `test_audit_extract_archetype_signals_present_and_typed` — guards the v1.31.0 contract.
- 4 first_turn_cost_share tests covering computed share, synthetic-skip, resume-marker-skip, and zero-turn case.

**No `_SCRIPT_VERSION` bump.** This is an audit-skill change; the session-metrics parse cache is untouched.

---

## v1.29.0 — 2026-04-29

### Feature — cache-aware audit pass (Tier-2 batch 1: positive findings + idle-gap cache decay)

The audit-session-metrics skill gains a positive findings array and an idle-gap-cache-decay trigger. Both fix structural problems the v1.28.0 integration test surfaced: Haiku padding the negative findings array with `"other"` filler when no real waste pattern fired, and the audit having no way to celebrate good cache hygiene.

### Schema

`digest_schema_version` and `audit_schema_version` bump to **1.1** (additive — no breaking changes to v1.0 consumers):

- New top-level array `positive_findings` (capped at 3, parallel to `findings`). Findings carry `estimated_savings_usd` rather than `estimated_impact_usd` to signal direction.
- New positive metric enum: `cache_savings_high` (savings > 3× cost OR > $5 absolute) and `cache_health_excellent` (hit ratio > 90% AND zero `cache_breaks`).
- New negative metric enum entry: `idle_gap_cache_decay` — fires when a > 5-minute gap (the 5m ephemeral cache TTL boundary) is followed by a turn where `cache_creation_input_tokens > 50%` of billable input. Aggregates the top 3 events into one finding; severity scales by total rebuild cost (low < $0.30, medium $0.30–$1, high > $1).
- The `"other"` enum is now **forbidden** in v1.1 outputs (was "use sparingly" in v1.0). Both `findings` and `positive_findings` arrays may be empty — that is the correct outcome when no triggers fire, not a defect.

### Why these specific triggers

- **Empirical**: the v1.28.0 integration test (session 8461c187) ran the helper script and found 4 honest negative triggers + 1 obvious positive (cache_savings $11.45 vs $40.83 cost = 28% savings). Haiku padded the audit with 2 `"other"` rows describing the cache savings and a synthetic-turn note. `positive_findings` is the structural fix — Haiku now has a place to put that observation rather than treating it as filler.
- **Cache-relevant**: idle gaps > 5 min cross the cache TTL boundary; cache rebuilds afterwards are a real recoverable cost. The 5m threshold matches the actual cache TTL (independent of the HTML `--idle-gap-minutes` UI default of 10 min, which is a *visual* threshold).
- **Backed by digest data, not vibes**: every threshold uses values already in the digest (`cache_savings`, `cache_hit_pct`, `cache_breaks`, per-turn timestamps, `cache_write_tokens`).

### Playbook contract

Both `quick-audit.md` and `detailed-audit.md` updated:

- Per-array caps are explicit and **independent** — 7 negative + 3 positive in quick mode, 16 negative + 3 positive in detailed mode. The arrays do not compete for slots.
- The "no padding" rule is now stronger: the `other` enum is forbidden in v1.1 outputs.
- New "Positive findings" markdown section renders after the findings table and top-3 turns, before `fix_first` / `quick_wins`. Section is omitted when `positive_findings` is empty.
- New `{savings_suffix}` render rule: appends ` — saved $<savings:.2f>` when `estimated_savings_usd` is non-null.

### Tests

10 new tests in `test_session_metrics.py` (561 total, +10 since v1.28.0):

- Schema version bump asserts.
- `cache_savings_high` fires on ratio threshold (3×) and absolute threshold ($5); does not fire when low.
- `cache_health_excellent` fires above 90% AND requires zero cache breaks (hard suppression).
- `idle_gap_cache_decay` fires after a > 5-min gap with cache rebuild; skips short gaps; skips when no rebuild; severity scales with cost.

The two playbook anchor tests gained v1.29.0 anchors (`positive_findings`, `cache_savings_high`, `cache_health_excellent`, `idle_gap_cache_decay`, `1.1`).

### Files

- `scripts/audit-extract.py` — `evaluate_positive_triggers()`, `_detect_idle_gap_cache_decay()`, idle_gap branch in `evaluate_triggers()`, `CACHE_TTL_5M_SECONDS` constant, `DIGEST_SCHEMA_VERSION = "1.1"`.
- `references/quick-audit.md` and `references/detailed-audit.md` — schema, metric enum tables, finding-cap section, render template.

No `_SCRIPT_VERSION` bump on `session-metrics.py` (this is an audit-skill change; the parse cache is untouched).

---

## v1.26.2 — 2026-04-28

### Bug fix — accumulate user content blocks across the gap (parallel-spawn sibling fix)

Sibling fix to v1.26.1's `agent_links` accumulator. `_extract_turns` was overwriting `last_user_content` on every user JSONL entry, so when N parallel Task tool_results landed in N separate user entries between two assistant turns, only the last entry's content survived into `_preceding_user_content`. Downstream content-block counters under-counted `tool_result` (and `image`) blocks on the next assistant turn by N−1.

Concrete example on the dev project's mini fixture: gap before `msg_C` contains both `u4` (tool_result) and `u5` (sidechain text). Pre-fix the parser kept only `u5`'s text block — `u4`'s tool_result was dropped from the count entirely. Post-fix both survive. Project-wide on the live dev repo, the totals `tool_result` count rises to reflect every parallel-spawn fan-in.

### Fix

`_extract_turns()` now accumulates blocks from every user entry in the inter-assistant gap into `gap_user_blocks`, falls back to `gap_user_str` when only a string-form content (compaction summary) appeared, and resets both on assistant first-occurrence. The per-iteration `last_user_content` is preserved for the inner-loop logic (compaction guard, slash-command detection, agent_link extraction) — only the SNAPSHOT shape changes.

```python
# in user branch (after agent_links extension):
if isinstance(last_user_content, list):
    gap_user_blocks.extend(last_user_content)
elif isinstance(last_user_content, str):
    gap_user_str = last_user_content

# in assistant first-occurrence:
if gap_user_blocks:
    preceding_user[msg_id] = list(gap_user_blocks)
elif gap_user_str is not None:
    preceding_user[msg_id] = gap_user_str
else:
    preceding_user[msg_id] = last_user_content   # back-to-back-assistants fallback
gap_user_blocks = []
gap_user_str = None
```

No `_SCRIPT_VERSION` bump — `_extract_turns` runs after the parse cache, not before.

### Tests

- New: `test_extract_turns_accumulates_parallel_tool_result_blocks` — three parallel Task spawns + three user-entry tool_results between two assistant turns; asserts all three tool_result blocks survive into `_preceding_user_content`.
- Updated: `test_fixture_content_block_counts_per_turn` and `test_fixture_totals_content_blocks_aggregate` — the existing mini fixture's gap before `msg_C` already had two user entries (line 8 tool_result + line 9 sidechain text). Pre-fix the line-8 tool_result was dropped from `msg_C`'s preceding-user content; post-fix it's counted. The tests previously asserted the buggy old count (0) and the buggy total (2); both are now corrected to reflect the accurate behaviour (1 and 3).

517 tests pass (515 existing + 2 new since v1.26.1).

### Severity

Cost/token math was unaffected (those come from assistant `usage` fields, not user content). The fix corrects display-layer signals: `content_blocks.tool_result` and `content_blocks.image` per turn and project-wide, plus any downstream that reads them (turn-character classification, content-block waste analysis).

---

## v1.26.1 — 2026-04-28

### Bug fix — recover subagent attribution lost on parallel Task spawns

`_extract_turns` was overwriting `last_user_agent_links` on every user JSONL entry instead of accumulating, so when the assistant emitted N parallel Task tool_uses in one turn, only the LAST `(tool_use_id, agentId)` pair survived. The other N−1 spawns lost their linkage and every subagent turn from those spawns counted as an orphan.

**Real impact on this dev project (35 session blocks, $1,041 total spend):**

| Signal | Before fix | After fix |
|---|---:|---:|
| Orphan subagent turns | 477 | 8 |
| Attributed subagent turns | 1,221 | 1,697 |
| Spawns recognised | 92 | 93 |
| Subagent share of cost | 3.5% | 4.62% |

The headline 3.5% share was understated by ~30% because the parser was dropping a third of all `(tool_use_id, agentId)` pairs from the JSONL even though the data was present in every parent log.

### Fix

`scripts/session-metrics.py:_extract_turns()` — change overwrite to extend, and reset on assistant first-occurrence so pairs from one inter-assistant gap don't leak into the next:

```python
# was:  last_user_agent_links = agent_links
last_user_agent_links.extend(agent_links)
...
# inside `if msg_id not in preceding_user:` block, after capture:
last_user_agent_links = []
```

Render-time only — no parser-cache schema change, no `_SCRIPT_VERSION` bump, parse cache stays valid.

### Tests

Two regression tests added near the existing Phase-B suite:

- `test_extract_turns_accumulates_parallel_task_agent_links` — synthesises an assistant turn with two parallel Task tool_uses + two separate user `tool_result` entries, asserts both `(tuid, agentId)` pairs survive into the next assistant's `_preceding_user_agent_links`.
- `test_extract_turns_resets_agent_links_after_assistant_first_occurrence` — asserts that pairs do NOT leak from one assistant gap into a later assistant's `_preceding_user_agent_links`.

516 tests pass (514 existing + 2 new).

### Caveat

8 turns remain orphaned in the dev project. These are genuine unrecoverable cases — two subagent JSONL files (`a51a9e01fd9c84bd2`, `af258417369f5ebc6`) lack any `toolUseResult.agentId` in their parent log, most likely because the subagent crashed/was killed before its tool_result could be written back. The headline keeps its `lower bound — N orphan turns excluded` caveat for the residual cases.

---

## v1.26.0 — 2026-04-28

### Observational subagent-cost framing — share, coverage, within-session split, warm-up signals

Builds on v1.7.0 Phase-B parent-prompt attribution to answer the question "what fraction of my session went to subagents, and how should I read that number?". Render-time only — no parser changes, no `_SCRIPT_VERSION` bump, parse cache stays valid.

### What's new

**Headline `Subagent share of cost` card** — top-of-report KPI in HTML (single + instance) and a row in the MD summary table. Reads `sum(attributed_subagent_cost) / totals.cost` and renders as `X% ($Y of $Z) across N spawns`. Branches on `--include-subagents`:
- on, with attributed turns: shows the share, with `lower bound — N orphan turns excluded` when `subagent_attribution_summary.orphan_subagent_turns > 0`.
- on, no subagent activity: `0% — no subagent activity`.
- off: `attribution disabled — re-run with --include-subagents` (avoids the deceptive 0% reading the previous default would have produced).

**Attribution coverage block** — small section under the by-subagent table that surfaces what was previously buried in `subagent_attribution_summary`: orphan turn count, cycles detected, max nesting depth, and spawn → attributed-turn fanout. Frames the headline as observational signal, not a precise measurement.

**Within-session spawning split** — per-session table comparing median *combined* turn cost (parent direct + attributed subagent) on spawning vs. non-spawning turns. Renders only for sessions with ≥3 turns in each bucket. Holds task / model / context constant within a session, but is explicitly labelled descriptive — selection bias remains because users delegate the hardest sub-tasks. *Not* a counterfactual estimate.

**Warm-up columns in `by_subagent_type`**:
- `First-turn %` — median across invocations of `first_turn.cost_usd / total_invocation_cost`. High = short-lived agents pay setup tax without amortising.
- `SP amortised %` — fraction of invocations whose turn ≥2 read from cache (system-prompt cache write paid back at least once).
- Visible only when `--include-subagents` is on AND at least one invocation was observed.

**Per-prompt badge** — appended `(NN% of combined cost)` to the existing `+N subagents` annotation. Labelled "combined", not "of turn", because the visible Cost column shows direct cost only; "% of turn" would mathematically imply the parent was 37% of itself.

### Honesty notes baked into the surfaces

- "Share" is used everywhere instead of "overhead" — overhead implies the cost would otherwise be unpaid, exactly the unanswered counterfactual.
- The headline is documented as a lower bound whenever orphans exist.
- The within-session split's body text states explicitly that descriptive correlation is *not* a counterfactual estimate.
- The synthetic-A/B benchmark and analytical crossover calculator are deferred to follow-ups; this release does not pretend to answer the causal "did delegating cost more" question.

### What changed in code

- `_empty_subagent_row` gains `invocation_count`, `first_turn_share_pct`, `sp_amortisation_pct`.
- `_build_by_subagent_type` groups subagent turns by `subagent_agent_id` per-invocation and rolls per-invocation metrics up to type rows. Aggregation is at report-build time, not per-turn — no parse-cache schema change.
- New helpers: `_compute_subagent_share`, `_compute_within_session_split`, `_compute_instance_subagent_share`, `_median`, `_build_subagent_share_card_html`, `_build_attribution_coverage_html`, `_build_within_session_split_html`, `_build_subagent_share_md`, `_build_within_session_split_md`.
- `_build_report` precomputes `subagent_share_stats` + `subagent_within_session_split` and stashes them on the report dict so JSON/CSV/MD/HTML all see the same values.
- `_build_instance_report` aggregates per-project shares and runs the within-session split over the flattened `all_sessions_out`. Instance report now propagates `include_subagents`.
- `render_html`, `render_md`, `_render_instance_html`, `_render_instance_md` updated.
- CSV `by_subagent_type` block gains `invocation_count`, `first_turn_share_pct`, `sp_amortisation_pct` columns.
- 8 new tests in `tests/test_session_metrics.py`. Existing 506 tests remain green.

### Known limitations

- The headline relies on Phase-B attribution; orphan rate matters. On a real session during manual verification, 45 of ~150 subagent turns were orphans (chains the three-pass linkage couldn't resolve back to a root prompt) — the share was clearly disclosed as a lower bound.
- The within-session split has within-session selection bias and does not replace a synthetic A/B test for the causal question.
- The compression-ratio signal (parent `tool_result` payload size vs. subagent gross spend) was considered but deferred — would require a parser change to capture `tool_result` text length and bump `_SCRIPT_VERSION`.

## v1.25.1 — 2026-04-28

### Bug fix — `iterations:null` crash when advisor is not enabled

`<synthetic>` resume-marker turns written by environments where the advisor feature
is not active (e.g. the desktop app) emit `"iterations": null` in the usage dict
rather than omitting the key. `u.get("iterations", [])` returns `None` when the key
exists with a null value, causing `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable` in
`_cost` and `_advisor_info` whenever a project-scope run included those sessions.

- Replace `u.get("iterations", [])` with `u.get("iterations") or []` in both
  `_cost` and `_advisor_info`. Handles absent, null, and valid-list cases identically.

---

## v1.25.0 — 2026-04-28

### Advisor turn support — cost correction + surface

The Claude Code Advisor (`advisor()` tool) runs a second model against the full conversation
transcript. Its tokens were previously hidden in `usage.iterations[]` and not counted, causing
advisor turns to be silently under-priced by up to 6.6×.

- **Cost correction**: `_cost()` now reads `usage.iterations[type=="advisor_message"]` and
  bills advisor tokens at the advisor model's list rates. The corrected `cost_usd` propagates
  to all session/project/instance aggregates.
- **New per-turn fields**: `advisor_calls`, `advisor_cost_usd`, `advisor_model`,
  `advisor_input_tokens`, `advisor_output_tokens`.
- **Session field**: `advisor_configured_model` from the top-level `advisorModel` JSONL field.
- **Content classification**: `server_tool_use` → letter `v`; `advisor_tool_result` → letter `R`.
  `"advisor"` appears in tool names and the drawer tools list.
- **Dashboard card**: "Advisor calls" (amber badge, auto-hidden when unused).
- **Session table**: amber annotation/badge in `--project-cost` HTML and text output.
- **CLI footer**: `Advisor calls : N call(s)  +$X.XXXX` when advisor was used.
- **Per-turn drawer**: cost section shows Primary / Advisor / Cost breakdown; TOKENS section
  shows Advisor input / Advisor output rows. Both hidden on non-advisor turns.
- **Schema docs** (`references/jsonl-schema.md`): four new fields documented.
- Graceful degradation — sessions without advisor activity produce identical output.

## v1.24.0 — 2026-04-28

### Fix: `file_reread` classification accuracy

- First access in any context segment no longer flagged as a wasteful re-read (only the
  2nd+ read in the same segment counts).
- Subagent-boundary re-reads (model switch or session resume) are now shown as informational
  — no ⚠ badge — because accessing files in a fresh context is expected and unavoidable.
- Drawer explanation splits into two branches: cross-context reads get tips on `offset`/`limit`;
  same-context re-reads get tips on `Grep` / `Read` with offsets.
- `_BASH_PATH_RE` extended-allowlist: hidden directories (`.claude`, `.git`) no longer produce
  false path entries in the classification detail.

## v1.23.0 — 2026-04-28

### Turn Character section in every turn drawer + cross-browser overflow fix

- Clicking any timeline row now shows a "Turn Character" section in the detail drawer with a
  colour-coded classification label and a one-sentence explanation derived from that turn's
  actual token data (file basenames, cache percentages, block counts, etc.).
- Fixed the ⚠ risk badge overflowing outside the timeline cell in Opera and other non-Chromium
  browsers.

## v1.22.0 — 2026-04-28

### 9-category turn waste classification

Classifies every assistant turn into one of: `productive`, `retry_error`, `file_reread`,
`oververbose_edit`, `dead_end`, `cache_payload`, `extended_thinking`, `subagent_dispatch`,
or `normal`.

- Turn Character column in the HTML timeline with colour-coded labels and ⚠ risk badges.
- Stacked-bar chart in the dashboard (waste distribution by session).
- Drill-down cards per waste category with turn count, token share, and examples.
- `turn_character` / `turn_risk` fields in JSON and CSV output.

## v1.21.0 — 2026-04-27

### Four inline markers in the HTML detail timeline

- Idle-gap dividers: slate pill `▮ N min idle` between turns when wall-clock gap ≥ threshold
  (`--idle-gap-minutes`, default 10; set 0 to disable).
- Model-switch dividers: cyan pill `⇄ Model: prev → cur` when the model changes mid-session.
- Truncated-response badge: orange `✂ truncated` on `max_tokens` turns + dashboard KPI card.
- Cache-break inline badge: amber `⚡` on turns that invalidate the prompt cache.

`stop_reason` and `is_cache_break` added as CSV columns.

## v1.20.1 — 2026-04-27

### Fix: spurious skill-tag badge after context compaction

Context-compaction summaries contain verbatim prior-session text including slash-command XML
tags. These were producing a false badge on the first post-compaction turn. Fixed by detecting
the compaction sentinel and skipping slash-command extraction for those entries.

## v1.20.0 — 2026-04-27

### Skill/slash-command badge in HTML timeline model column

When a turn was triggered by a skill invocation or slash command (e.g. `session-metrics`), a
small purple badge appears inline in the timeline. The turn drawer also shows a "Skill" row.

## v1.19.0 — 2026-04-26

### Per-turn latency + session wall-clock

- `latency_seconds` per turn: wall-clock seconds from preceding user entry to the assistant
  response.
- `wall_clock_seconds` per session (first user prompt → last assistant).
- Markdown summary gains `Wall clock` and `Mean turn latency` rows.
- `--compare-run-prompt-steering` wrapper for prompt-steering sweeps via `--compare-run`.

## v1.18.2 — 2026-04-25

### Fix: Console theme turn drawer transparent background

## v1.18.1 — 2026-04-25

### Fix: cache-breaks/skills/subagents sections duplicated in detail.html

The cross-cutting summary sections (cache breaks, skills, subagents) now appear only in the
dashboard page, not in both the dashboard and the detail page.

## v1.18.0 — 2026-04-25

### `--include-subagents` on by default

Subagent JSONL files are now included in session reports automatically. Opt out with
`--no-include-subagents`. Also fixes the subagent hint label in the Insights dashboard card.

## v1.17.1 — 2026-04-25

### Fix: cache-breaks section unstyled in non-default themes

Cache-break section elements now have correct colours across all four themes (Beacon, Console,
Lattice, Pulse).

## v1.17.0 — 2026-04-25

### Subagent → parent-prompt token attribution

Maps every subagent turn's tokens back to the originating user prompt via a three-stage
linkage chain (`tool_use.id → prompt_anchor → agent_id → root`).

- HTML prompts table sorts by `cost_usd + attributed_subagent_cost` by default — the "what
  action cost the most" lens.
- "Subagents +$" column and "+N subagents" row badge auto-appear when attribution is present.
- `--sort-prompts-by {total,self}` and `--no-subagent-attribution` flags.
- Three new CSV columns: `attributed_subagent_tokens`, `attributed_subagent_cost`,
  `attributed_subagent_count`.

## v1.16.0 — 2026-04-25

### Cross-cutting sections: cache breaks, skills & slash commands, subagent summary

Four new summary sections in the HTML dashboard for every session / project export:
cache-break cost analysis, skill/slash-command invocation table, and subagent type breakdown.
`--cache-break-threshold N` (default 500 tokens) controls the minimum re-fill size to report.

## v1.15.2 — 2026-04-25

### 10 additional model pricing entries + regex/prefix matching tier

Extended `_PRICING` with 10 more models. Prefix matching covers entire model families without
requiring exact `model_id` entries. Stderr advisory emitted for truly unknown models.

## v1.15.1 — 2026-04-25

### Non-Claude model pricing: GLM, Gemma 4, Qwen 3.5

Correct per-token rates for GLM-4.7 / GLM-5 / GLM-5.1 (Z.ai), Gemma 4 (Google / Ollama
local variants), and Qwen 3.5:9b. Prevents silent Sonnet-rate mis-attribution on mixed-model
sessions.

## v1.15.0 — 2026-04-24

### 4-theme picker embedded in every HTML export

All four themes (Beacon, Console, Lattice, Pulse) are embedded in every generated HTML file.
Users switch at view-time via a top-nav button strip; choice persists across Dashboard↔Detail
and instance→project drill-down links via URL hash + localStorage. Console is the default.
Also: 25% font size increase, Highcharts bundle gated to single-page variant only.

## v1.14.1 — 2026-04-23

### Fix: instance dashboard chart shows real token breakdowns

Instance daily chart now shows stacked input/output/cache-read/cache-write token breakdown per
day (was showing cost-only bars). Day axis label added.

## v1.14.0 — 2026-04-22

### Instance-level "all projects" dashboard

`--all-projects` generates a single dashboard aggregating every project under your Claude Code
install. Summary cards, daily cost timeline, projects table (sorted by cost, with clickable
drilldown links to per-project dashboards), and reused weekly/punchcard/time-of-day insights.
`--no-project-drilldown` fast path, `--projects-dir PATH` override for custom installs.
Output lands in `exports/session-metrics/instance/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS/`.

## v1.13.1 — 2026-04-22

### Fix: `_resolve_tz` docstring correction

Corrected internal docstring that incorrectly described an `Intl.DateTimeFormat` implementation.

## v1.13.0 — 2026-04-22

### IFEval paired-samples statistics: McNemar test + Wilson CI

`--compare` HTML report gains a statistical significance table: McNemar χ² + p-value and
Wilson 95% CI for each IFEval pass-rate comparison. Small-N banner suppresses stats when
fewer than 6 paired samples are available.

## v1.12.0 — 2026-04-22

### `--strict-tz` flag + Windows tzdata hint

`--strict-tz` exits with a clear error when the system's zoneinfo database cannot resolve the
requested IANA timezone (the default is lenient — falls back to UTC). On Windows, an advisory
hints to install the `tzdata` pip package when `ZoneInfo` fails to load.

## v1.11.3 — 2026-04-21

### Audit Tier 3 fixes: test hygiene + cost note

Added a comment inside `_cost()` pointing to the fast-mode 6× multiplier caveat in
`references/pricing.md`. Test temp-directory randomisation and `atexit` contract pin.

## v1.11.2 — 2026-04-21

### Audit Tier 2 hardening: contract pin

`atexit` advisory handler is now registered at module load time (not lazily), so it fires even
in early-exit paths.

## v1.11.1 — 2026-04-21

### Audit Tier 1 hardening + `--allow-unverified-charts` flag

- Theme-aware drawer backdrop, `<meta name="chart-lib">` in every HTML export, `@media print`
  hide rules for cleaner PDF output.
- Unknown-model `stderr` advisory at process exit (lists models that fell through to Sonnet
  default pricing).
- Fast-mode `stderr` advisory with count of `usage.speed == "fast"` turns.
- `--compare`, `--compare-prep`, `--compare-run`, `--count-tokens-only` are now mutually
  exclusive via argparse group.
- `--allow-unverified-charts` opt-in to skip Highcharts vendor SHA-256 check for offline
  workflows.

## v1.11.0 — 2026-04-21

### Clickable per-turn timeline rows with full detail drawer

Every row in the HTML detail timeline is now clickable. Clicking opens a right-side sliding
drawer showing: turn metadata (model, cost, tokens, stop reason), prompt text, all tool calls
with input previews, and a linked prompts table. Keyboard-accessible (Enter/Escape).

## v1.10.0 — 2026-04-20

### Custom prompt commands in SKILL.md

SKILL.md dispatch extended with custom prompt-command rows so Claude routes natural-language
requests like "compare these two sessions" or "run a headless compare" to the correct flags
without ambiguity. README updated with command examples.

## v1.9.0 — 2026-04-20

### `--compare-run` headless automation

`--compare-run` spawns two `claude -p` sessions headlessly, feeds each one the same prompt
suite, and then calls `--compare` on the resulting JSONLs — a single command for an end-to-end
A/B model benchmark. `[1m]` default effort prefix added to prompt suite entries.

## v1.8.0 — 2026-04-20

### Session-resume detection: `claude -c` and terminal-exit markers

Detects two resume patterns in the JSONL: the `<synthetic>` model marker (auto-continuation
after context limit) and the `/exit` + re-open pattern (manual terminal-exit resume). Both are
surfaced as timeline dividers and counted in the dashboard "Session resumes" card. Terminal
exits are visually distinguished from normal resumes.

## v1.7.1 — 2026-04-19

### Subagent-related fixes

Minor UI fixes to subagent display in the dashboard and timeline.

## v1.7.0 — 2026-04-19

### `--compare` two-session A/B comparison (Phases 1–9 + trigger hardening)

`session-metrics --compare A.jsonl B.jsonl` produces a paired comparison: side-by-side token/
cost/cache metrics, IFEval-style pass-rate evaluation (sentinel-tagged prompt suite, 10 built-in
predicates), paired-turn table, quality-vs-cost verdict, and a shareable single-page HTML
report. Also includes `--compare-prep` to generate a canonical prompt suite, and
`--count-tokens-only` (API-key path) to estimate token counts before running.

Three-layer trigger discipline: argparse mutex, SKILL.md `$ARGUMENTS[0]` dispatch gate, and
description-level LLM guard prevent accidental invocation on unrelated prompts.

## v1.6.0 — 2026-04-19

### `/usage`-style Usage Insights panel on the dashboard

New dashboard section mirroring the data Claude Code's `/usage` command surfaces: total spend,
cache efficiency, model breakdown, top-sessions table, and conditional insight cards
(model-compare nudge, fast-mode advisory, etc.). Threshold-gated so cards only appear when the
data is meaningful.

## v1.5.0 — 2026-04-18

### Resume-marker cost tracking

Session-resume markers now carry a token/cost estimate for the context re-fill cost incurred
by resuming the conversation. Surfaced in the dashboard card and timeline divider subtitle.

## v1.4.1 — 2026-04-18

### Fix: terminal-exit marker visually distinguished from resume marker

The dashboard card correctly reported "2 resumes · 1 terminal exit" but the timeline dividers
were rendering all three as identical "↻ Session resumed" pills. Terminal-exit markers now
render with a distinct visual style (`⊠ Session ended`) so both surfaces tell a consistent
story.

## v1.4.0 — 2026-04-18

### Session-resume detection (initial)

Detects `claude -c` resumes via the `/exit` + `<synthetic>` fingerprint and surfaces resume
events in the dashboard and HTML timeline.

## v1.3.0 — 2026-04-18

### Content-block distribution (Proposal B) + streaming-dedup fix

Per-turn and aggregate counts for `thinking`, `tool_use`, `text`, `tool_result`, and `image`
content blocks. HTML Content column with compact letter encoding and tooltips. Extended-thinking
and Tool-calls dashboard cards. CSV gains five new block-count columns.

Fix: multi-entry streaming messages were losing all but the last content block. `_extract_turns`
now unions blocks across all occurrences of the same `message.id`.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-04-18

### Ephemeral cache TTL drilldown (Proposal A) — pricing accuracy

Splits `cache_creation_input_tokens` into 5-minute and 1-hour buckets and prices each at its
correct Anthropic rate. Previously all cache writes were charged at the 5m rate, causing
up to 60% undercount of the cache-write component for sessions that used 1-hour TTL.

HTML: TTL badge on CacheWr cells. Text/MD: `*` suffix on affected cells. CSV/JSON: three new
per-turn fields. Dashboard: Cache TTL mix card.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-04-18

### uPlot + Chart.js MIT-licensed chart alternatives

`--chart-lib {highcharts,uplot,chartjs,none}`. uPlot (~45 KB, MIT) and Chart.js (~70 KB, MIT)
are fully vendored with SHA-256 manifest verification. Use `--chart-lib uplot` for a fully
MIT-licensed export; `--chart-lib none` for a zero-JS archive.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-04-17

### First stable release

- Per-turn token/cost/cache breakdown across 5-hour session blocks.
- Multi-format export: text, JSON, CSV, Markdown, HTML (2-page dashboard + detail).
- Usage insights: weekly roll-up, session duration + burn rate, hour-of-day punchcard,
  weekday × hour heatmap, 5-hour session-block analysis.
- Vendored Highcharts (`--chart-lib highcharts`) with SHA-256 integrity check.
- Parse cache (`~/.cache/session-metrics/`) for fast re-analysis of unchanged JSONLs.
- Input validation, path containment, timezone support (`--tz`, `--utc-offset`).
- Pricing table covers claude-opus-4-7 / sonnet-4-6 / haiku-4-5 + historical models.
